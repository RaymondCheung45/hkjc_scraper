A Atzeni was suspended from riding in races for one Hong Kong raceday to be conducted on Wednesday, 1 November 2023 at Happy Valley.  In assessing penalty, the Stewards determined the carelessness grade 2 and the consequences grade 2 and also considered his excellent race riding record.  When questioned regarding the disappointing performance, Z Purton stated that SPLENDID STAR settled comfortably in the early stages in a forward position.  He said after the pace increased from the 1600 Metres, his mount was crossed by RING BELLS in the Back Straight and came under pressure from the 1000 Metres.  He added with SPLENDID STAR stepping up in weight today and the pace of the event being quicker than at its last start, SPLENDID STAR, although interfered with at the 400 Metres, was still disappointing.

The Stewards opened an inquiry into B Avdulla’s riding of CHILLI BABA between the 400 Metres and the 200 Metres.  Evidence was taken from Jockey Avdulla and Trainer P F Yiu.  B Avdulla stated that from the inside barrier he was instructed to hold a midfield position but was issued with no specific instructions as to when to place his mount under pressure.  He said after following PINS PRINCE into the race, he elected to remain racing behind that runner on straightening with a view to improving behind it.  He said when PINS PRINCE became held up and did not proceed forward, this resulted in CHILLI BABA also being held up behind that runner before he then shifted to its outside near the 300 Metres to look for clear running.  He added between the 300 Metres and the 200 Metres he was unable to commit to a run to the outside of TOP TOP TEA as he was concerned that HERO ICON was giving ground and for this reason he did not immediately shift out.  He further stated that approaching the 200 Metres he was able to direct CHILLI BABA to the outside of TOP TOP TEA and HERO ICON whereby CHILLI BABA initially responded well to his riding before its run ended near the 100 Metres.  Mr Yiu confirmed the instructions issued and expressed satisfaction with the manner in which B Avdulla rode the horse.  After considering the evidence, the Stewards advised B Avdulla that he had persevered for too long behind PINS PRINCE and TOP TOP TEA when there was an opportunity to shift to the outside of those runners sooner to present CHILLI BABA with clear running.  In electing not to take the matter further, the Stewards were mindful that CHILLI BABA had peaked on its run at the 100 Metres and could not be satisfied that B Avdulla’s actions had impacted on the finishing position of CHILLI BABA.  However, Jockey Avdulla was advised that he must ensure he shows better judgement and reacts quicker to ensure that his mounts are given first available opportunity to improve.

The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the riding of Apprentice E C W Wong after he obtained a narrow run to the inside of BON’S A PEARLA near the 1000 Metres and then when he allowed his mount to improve to the inside of MALDIVES near the 750 Metres where there was insufficient room to do so, resulting in PERFECT TEAM having to be checked.  After taking evidence from Apprentice Wong, his allocated master, Mr C Fownes, and the Chief Riding Instructor, Mr F Coetzee, the Stewards advised Apprentice Wong that in respect of both incidents he had permitted his mount to improve where there was not sufficient room to do so and that in similar circumstances he would be expected to show far greater judgement than he did on this occasion.  He was further advised that whilst a narrow run had developed to the inside of FIERY DIAMOND soon after entering the Home Straight, once again he should have shown better judgement by not attempting to improve to the inside of that runner where, in the opinion of the Stewards, there was also doubtful room which resulted in PERFECT TEAM having to be shifted to the outside of FIERY DIAMOND near the 250 Metres to secure clear running.

The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in as they were of the view that an incident had occurred inside the 100 Metres where CHAMPION INSTINCT had shifted in and made contact with RUBYLOT which cast doubt  as to whether RUBYLOT should  be declared the outright second placegetter.  Subsequently the Stewards, acting under the provisions of Rule 122, lodged a protest/objection on behalf of the connections of RUBYLOT alleging interference inside the 100 Metres.  After considering the evidence, including the patrol films, the Stewards found that near the 100 Metres CHAMPION INSTINCT shifted in and made contact with RUBYLOT on two occasions, taking RUBYLOT in and restricting L Hewitson’s ability to fully ride his mount out to the finish of the event.  As the Stewards were comfortably satisfied that had the interference not occurred RUBYLOT would have finished in outright second place, the protest/objection was sustained and the placings amended to read No. 2, CHAMPION METHOD, 1st; No. 4, RUBYLOT, 2nd; No. 12, CHAMPION INSTINCT, 3rd; and No. 7, MASSIVE TALENT, 4th.

He said as a result he was obliged to settle at the rear of the field to ensure his mount had cover.  When questioned if there was an opportunity to improve to the outside of SUPER CONTENTED from the 600 Metres, K Teetan stated that he was concerned that had he done so, SUPER CONTENTED would shift out and take his mount wider.  He said for this reason he elected to remain racing behind SUPER CONTENTED with a view to following WAR OF COURAGE into the race.  He said near the 500 Metres when SUPER CONTENTED shifted out slightly, he was obliged to steady away from the heels of that runner and as a result his mount lost momentum.  He added as a result of this incident WAR OF COURAGE was able to improve into the event where his mount was then left flat-footed.  He further stated that after being held up for clear running in the early part of the Home Straight, he then attempted to improve to the outside of WAR OF COURAGE near the 300 Metres, but was disappointed for this run when SUPER CONTENTED held its position to his outside.  He said as a consequence he was obliged to shift to the inside of WAR OF COURAGE where he secured clear running at the 200 Metres.  Trainer J Size confirmed the instructions issued and the reasons as to why such instructions were issued.  He stated that, in his opinion, K Teetan would have been better suited, having regard to the moderate early pace, by making a run to the outside sooner than what he did.  K Teetan agreed with the Stewards that he had made a slight error of judgement in not improving to the outside of SUPER CONTENTED from the 550 Metres.

When questioned regarding his riding of HARMONY N BLESSED, Apprentice Y L Chung stated that he was instructed, with SUPER COMMANDER and FORTUNE WARRIOR being speed horses, to endeavour to take a seat behind those two horses in the early stages.  He said from a wide barrier he rode HARMONY N BLESSED along whereby it then commenced to race keenly and approaching the 850 Metres he endeavoured to comply with his instructions, but was unable to do so due to his mount continuing to race too keenly. Trainer D A Hayes confirmed the instructions were to take cover with noted speed runners in the event.  Apprentice Chung was advised that he had made an error of judgement in the early stages in riding his mount with too much vigour for too long which resulted in HARMONY N BLESSED not being ridden in accordance with the instructions that he was issued.  A veterinary inspection immediately following the race which included an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse’s trachea.

When questioned if there was an opportunity to restrain his mount sooner than what he did, K Teetan agreed with the Stewards that in retrospect he had persisted for too long in an endeavour to cross HARMONY N BLESSED.  Trainer P C Ng confirmed the instructions issued to Jockey Teetan and said that such instructions issued were consistent with the horse’s previous race starts.

He said from the inside barrier this evening he was asked not to place KYRUS DRAGON under pressure in the early stages to allow it to settle as KYRUS DRAGON was being dropped back to 1000 Metres where a strong pace was expected.  He added in accordance with his instructions he allowed KYRUS DRAGON to settle towards the back of the field, but it finished the race off only fairly.  Trainer D J Hall confirmed the instructions issued and stated that KYRUS DRAGON had raced keenly at its last race start and this was the reason why the horse was dropping back to a 1000 Metre race tonight.

He said after entering the Back Straight he allowed TURIN MASCOT to stride forward, but his mount did not show sufficient pace to cross runners to his inside and as a result he was obliged to race wide and without cover for the remainder of the event.  He added that when caught wide, he felt it was in the best interests of TURIN MASCOT not to be made use of to cross runners to his inside as the horse had won when ridden in a similar manner last season.

2023-12-20,H109,HK_2022_H109,CHILL CHIBI,6,"When questioned regarding the tactics adopted, C L Chau stated that from the outside barrier he was given the instructions to endeavour to hold a midfield position preferably with cover.  He said on jumping CHILL CHIBI commenced well and in accordance with the manner he usually rides the horse from the barriers, he placed it under pressure for a short distance to ensure it held its position at the start.  He said when caught wide in the early stages and when the pace of the event was slow, he allowed CHILL CHIBI to stride forward and take up a position outside the early leader DROMBEG BANNER.  He added that when GALAXY WITNESS improved forward along the Back Straight, he was able to obtain a position with cover behind DROMBEG BANNER and making the Home Turn improved to the outside of DROMBEG BANNER to start his run.  He said when placed under pressure at this point CHILL CHIBI became one-paced and did not immediately respond to his riding which resulted in HAPPY TOGETHER improving around his mount and CHILL CHIBI then being placed in restricted room for a short distance near the 250 Metres when DROMBEG BANNER shifted out slightly and HAPPY TOGETHER shifted in.  He further stated that after shifting to the outside of HAPPY TOGETHER near the 150 Metres, CHILL CHIBI finished the race off reasonably well and, in his opinion, was looking for additional distance.  Assistant Trainer T H So confirmed the instructions were to endeavour to find a midfield position, but also confirmed if this was not available, the option to take up a more forward position was available to Jockey Chau.  The Stewards found the tactics adopted by Jockey Chau, having regard to the early sectionals of the event, were reasonable in the circumstances.

2023-12-20,H117,HK_2022_H117,DROMBEG BANNER,2,"When questioned regarding the tactics adopted on DROMBEG BANNER and particularly the slow pace set throughout the early and middle stages, A Atzeni advised that he had expected to lead on DROMBEG BANNER and with this in mind, after commencing well, he was able to obtain the lead in the early stages.  He said from the 1200 Metres DROMBEG BANNER, which was having its first race start at Happy Valley, had some difficulty making the turns and for this reason approaching the 1000 Metres got its head up when he was obliged to place pressure on his right rein to make that turn.  He said after entering the Back Straight he allowed DROMBEG BANNER to race at a pace which was comfortable but was then taken on in the lead when GALAXY WITNESS improved forward near the 900 Metres.  When questioned if there was an opportunity to set a more even pace throughout the early and middle stages, A Atzeni stated that he felt his mount was racing at a comfortable pace, but agreed with the Stewards that in hindsight he should have allowed DROMBEG BANNER to set a more even pace through that section of the race so as to avoid another runner taking his mount on during the event.  Trainer P C Ng confirmed the instructions issued and expressed satisfaction with the tactics adopted by Jockey  Atzeni.  Mr Ng further stated that whilst he expected DROMBEG BANNER to  race in a more competitive manner, he was still satisfied with its performance tonight.

He said after settling back in the field when following the favourite in the event FIGHTING MACHINE, he was content to remain racing behind that runner approaching the Home Turn, but then elected to shift to its outside near the 500 Metres when FIGHTING MACHINE initially did not improve.  He added as a result he then became held up for clear running behind BEYOND TURBO before shifting to that runner’s inside approaching the 300 Metres whereby he secured clear running and MAXIMIZE HEART finished the race off well.  When questioned if there was an opportunity to shift to the outside on the Home Turn and provide his mount with a clear run sooner than what it had obtained, A Atzeni stated that bearing in mind his instructions, he felt it would be best to ride MAXIMIZE HEART between horses to save it up for a final run to the finish.  Trainer C H Yip confirmed the instructions issued.

He said although TOP SCORER commenced well today and it would have been open to him to go forward, given the specific instructions issued, he elected to come back in order to find cover and ride in accordance with his instructions.  He said in the early stages when positioned to the outside and behind HAPPY FOR ALL, he was of the view that HAPPY FOR ALL would obtain a position with cover behind CORDYCEPS ONE and for this reason he elected to come back and race behind ONLY U to avoid being caught wide and without cover.  He said after obtaining a trailing position behind ONLY U near the 1000 Metres, TOP SCORER travelled reasonably well.  He added from the 600 Metres when the pace of the race quickened he commenced to encourage TOP SCORER to go forward, but his mount became one-paced for some distance thereafter and after shifting to the outside of ONLY U at the entrance to the Home Straight ran home strongly.  Mr Size confirmed the instructions were to endeavour to hold a midfield position with cover but also said that Jockey Purton was given the option to settle further back if he was not able to obtain a midfield position with cover.  He said the instructions issued to Jockey Purton today were due to TOP SCORER not beginning well at its only two previous race starts and felt that, given the wide draw today, such instructions would provide TOP SCORER with the best opportunity to finish the race off.  After considering the evidence of Jockey Purton and Trainer Size, the Stewards found the tactics adopted by Jockey Purton in the circumstances were reasonable.",3,9

He said he was also instructed if possible he should make his run to the inside in the Home Straight as connections had formed the opinion that it was advantageous to improve on this section of the track.  He said he shifted DAN ATTACK across behind runners in the early stages where his mount raced keenly.  He said after following KING ECCELLENTE into the Home Straight, he initially ascertained as to whether a run was available to the inside of KING ECCELLENTE having regard to his instructions.  He said when KING ECCELLENTE maintained its position towards the inside, he then observed the run available to the outside of YOUTH POWER and behind OUR LUCKY GLORY where he endeavoured to balance DAN ATTACK up and then commenced to allow it to improve into the event.  He added near the 200 Metres once fully balanced he was able to place DAN ATTACK under pressure where it finished the race off reasonably well.  When questioned regarding his vigour between the 300 Metres and the 200 Metres, A Hamelin stated that at all stages through this section of the race he was urging his mount forward, but having regard to his previous experience with the horse, where it was required to be balanced before being placed under full pressure, he was reluctant to ride his mount along fully through this section of the race.  Trainer J Richards confirmed the instructions issued and expressed satisfaction with his ride.  After considering his explanations, the Stewards advised A Hamelin that he had made an error of judgement between the 300 Metres and the 200 Metres by not placing his mount under full pressure to follow OUR LUCKY GLORY into the event.  Whilst the Stewards found Jockey Hamelin had made an error of judgement, they were satisfied that his actions had not resulted in DAN ATTACK not finishing the best possible placing in the field.",3,9

He said in the early stages he was able to obtain a position behind ENIGMA, however, that runner raced keenly and got its head up on a number of occasions.  He added that after entering the Back Straight when he observed FLAMINGO TRILLION racing in a three wide position, he was of the view it would be advantageous to shift NOBLE PURSUIT out and to follow FLAMINGO TRILLION to provide his mount with a trail into the event.  He added when he commenced a forward move, ENIGMA, which had continued to race keenly, shifted out which resulted in NOBLE PURSUIT being taken four wide and without cover near the 1100 Metres.  He said as a result when he was of the view the pace of the event would allow him to do so, he then commenced to allow NOBLE PURSUIT to stride forward with a view to crossing FLAMINGO TRILLION.  He said as he commenced to do so, the pace of the event quickened when FLAMINGO TRILLION endeavoured to prevent NOBLE PURSUIT from crossing which then resulted in NOBLE PURSUIT being obliged to race four wide and without cover until near the 600 Metres.  After considering the explanations, the Stewards found the tactics adopted by Jockey Bowman were reasonable and that he would not have been able to reasonably anticipate ENIGMA shifting out near the 1100 Metres as its rider Apprentice Y L Chung had endeavoured to remain racing behind LEAN HERO throughout the early and middle stages.

Whilst the Stewards were satisfied that K C Leung’s action in attempting to regain control of his whip was an instinctive one, he was nevertheless advised, wherever possible, he should ensure that his focus remains on riding his mounts out to the finish of the event.

He said as he commenced to do so, CHARITY BINGO then shifted in towards the running rail, but as he was committed to the inside of the heels of CHARITY BINGO, he was unable to shift out to secure clear running.

He said when RUNNING AHEAD held its position to his inside, ROYAL PRIDE was obliged to race wide and without cover for the majority of the event.  Trainer C Fownes confirmed the instructions issued.  Trainer C Fownes will be interviewed relative to ROYAL PRIDE being presented and racing with a hood, not part of its approved racing gear. <10/3/2024 – 6 March 2024 Happy Valley Racemeeting – Race 3 (477)> The Stewards today conducted an inquiry in relation to ROYAL PRIDE being presented and racing with a hood, not part of its approved gear in the abovementioned race. Evidence was taken from Mr C Fownes, trainer of ROYAL PRIDE, Mr Fownes’ assistant trainer Mr C K Chung and Mr W L Tsang, stables assistant of ROYAL PRIDE. The evidence established that ROYAL PRIDE was transported to the Happy Valley Racecourse with a black hood. Upon arrival the horse was attended by Mr Tsang and a yellow pre-race hood, part of ROYAL PRIDE’S approved gear, was inadvertently placed over the black hood by Mr Tsang before ROYAL PRIDE was taken to the saddling stalls to be saddled by Mr Fownes. Mr Fownes advised that as the pre-race hood was covering the black hood he did not detect that the black hood was fitted to ROYAL PRIDE. As ROYAL PRIDE was presented in the Parade Ring with a yellow pre-race hood covering the black hood, gear inspections performed by the Stewards in the Parade Ring had not identified that the black hood had been fitted to ROYAL PRIDE as the yellow pre-race hood, in accordance with standard practice, had not been removed from ROYAL PRIDE until once at the starting gates. Mr Fownes pleaded guilty to a charge under Rule 96 in that he did negligently present ROYAL PRIDE to race in Race 3 at the Happy Valley racemeeting on 6 March 2024 in a hood, which was not part of that horse's declared gear, which resulted in ROYAL PRIDE wearing a hood in the said race. Mr Fownes was fined the sum of $15,000. The Stewards have now updated their standard operating procedures to minimise the risk of such error occurring again. A report will be made to the Head of Dual Site Stables Operations in respect to Mr Tsang erroneously applying a hood to ROYAL PRIDE.",8,3

2024-03-10,J020,HK_2023_J020,GIDDY UP,4,"When questioned, J McDonald stated that his instructions were to settle his mount where comfortable but not to make use of it as it had previously over-raced when ridden forward in the early stages.  He said from the inside barrier GIDDY UP jumped reasonably well but in accordance with his instructions he did not push it along in the early stages to hold a more forward position.  He said as a result TALENTS AMBITION was able to shift across his mount in the early stages which resulted in GIDDY UP setting towards the rear of the field.  He added approaching the first turn when TALENTS AMBITION shifted out, he was able to allow GIDDY UP to improve to the inside of that runner and follow MASTER OF FORTUNE.  He further stated that from the 600 Metres when he remained positioned behind MASTER OF FORTUNE, his visibility was impaired due to the kickback from runners in front and as a result he was not able to proceed forward from the 600 Metres to the 400 Metres when there was not sufficient room to do so.  He said after entering the Home Straight he shifted to the outside of MASTER OF FORTUNE to follow BEAUTY FIT, but was held up for clear running from the 350 Metres until the 200 Metres where he was able to place GIDDY UP under full pressure and the horse finished the race off well.  Trainer J Richards confirmed the instructions issued and as GIDDY UP was stepping up to 1600 Metres and when ridden forward from an inside barrier at Happy Valley on 20 December 2023, GIDDY UP raced keenly and as a result did not finish the race off.  He said this was the basis for issuing the instructions to Jockey McDonald.  Mr Richards added that whilst he had expected GIDDY UP settling in a more forward position, he was of the view that due to GIDDY UP being held up in the early part of the Home Straight, this had impacted the horse’s chances of finishing in a more forward position.

He said near the 200 Metres he observed a run become available between RED ELEGANCE and PARENTS’ LOVE and initially was going to take advantage of that run, however, when PARENTS’ LOVE shifted out approaching the 150 Metres when being corrected by its rider Apprentice Y L Chung, he then elected to shift to that runner’s inside in an attempt to secure clear running between PARENTS’ LOVE and GLORY ELITE.  He added when GLORY ELITE shifted out and PARENTS’ LOVE maintained a straight course, this resulted in FLYING PHANTOM being badly held up over the final 100 Metres and not being able to be ridden out to the finish of the event.  After considering B Avdulla’s explanations, the Stewards were satisfied that near the 150 Metres Apprentice Chung had endeavoured to correct his mount which resulted In PARENTS’ LOVE shifting out slightly and in the circumstances were satisfied that B Avdulla’s decision to shift to the inside of that runner was reasonable in the circumstances.",8,4

He said after settling back in the field he was reluctant from the 800 Metres to shift to the outside of BROTHER PEARL to improve into the event as he was concerned that his mount then would have to make a wide run, which would be contrary to his instructions.

For this declaration error, Trainer D J Whyte was fined $2,000.  When questioned regarding his riding, H Bowman stated that from the outside barrier he was instructed to ride his mount in a conservative manner in the early stages as connections had assessed the early pace of the event would potentially be run inside of standard time.  He said after settling back in the field he rode his mount along from the 600 Metres to improve where ACE ONE responded only fairly to his riding.  He said entering the Home Straight he considered shifting to the outside of LUCKY QUALITY, but as ACE ONE was not travelling well enough to do so, he then elected to endeavour to improve into a run between LUCKY QUALITY and SUPER GLORY.  He added that when SUPER GLORY shifted out slightly near the 250 Metres, he then directed his mount to the inside of SUPER GLORY to obtain clear running, however, shortly after SUPER GLORY shifted back in and when ACE ONE was then positioned inside the heels of SUPER GLORY, he was held up for clear running between the 200 Metres and the 150 Metres.  He further stated that over the concluding stages ACE ONE finished the race off only fairly.  Trainer D J Whyte confirmed the instructions issued and stated that whilst ACE ONE had been ridden forward from wide draws in the past, such instructions were issued to offset the expected fast early pace of the event.  The Stewards found the tactics adopted by Jockey Bowman, having regard to his explanations, were reasonable in the circumstances.",12,2

When questioned regarding his riding rounding the Home Turn and as to whether there was an opportunity to improve to the outside of GIMME FIVE, L Hewitson stated that his instructions were to settle his mount where comfortable and anticipated racing in a midfield position.  He said leaving the 500 Metres when GIMME FIVE did not improve into the event, he became awkwardly placed close to the heels of that runner and whilst his intention was to shift to that runner’s outside, he was unable to do so due to his mount being placed too close to the heels of GIMME FIVE and also because ACE POWER was positioned directly to his outside.  He added near the 400 Metres when he observed DRACO to improve forward, he elected to shift in to follow that runner into the event.  L Hewitson further stated that after riding his mount along in the early part of the Home Straight, SIGHT HERO then had difficulty obtaining clear running between SPEEDY SMARTIE and DRACO near the 150 Metres and could not be fully tested until after the 100 Metres where his mount finished off in a one-paced manner.

When questioned regarding his riding in the middle stages and the reason FASTPASS raced wide and without cover from the 800 Metres, M F Poon stated that his mount did not travel well throughout the event.  He said whilst he had a trailing position behind GO GO GO, he placed his mount under pressure near the 850 Metres to encourage it to travel and as he placed FASTPASS under pressure with the whip, it shifted out which allowed LEATHER MASTER to improve to his inside.  He added as a result FASTPASS was obliged to race wide and without cover from the 800 Metres, but never responded to his riding and gave ground in the Home Straight.  Trainer C H Yip confirmed that the intention had been to hold a handy position with cover, but agreed with Jockey Poon that FASTPASS had come under pressure in the middle stages which resulted in FASTPASS shifting out near the 800 Metres.

When the Stewards were satisfied that there were not sufficient grounds and the connections had elected not to lodge a protest/objection, weighed-in was declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.  When questioned regarding his riding and the reason he elected to shift to the outside of SMILING COLLECTOR near the 250 Metres, H Bowman stated that his initial intention was to improve between GRAND BOSS and SMILING COLLECTOR, however, when SMILING COLLECTOR shifted in slightly approaching the 250 Metres, he was then committed to shifting to that runner’s outside to improve.

He further stated that when SO AWESOME held its position to his inside, he then elected to restrain his mount and obtain cover near the 800 Metres when he was of the opinion that COSMO NAVIGATOR was not showing sufficient pace to cross runners to his inside.

Evidence was today taken from Mr F C Lor, trainer of SAVVY CHIC.  It was established that due to the late closure of entries for this event the stable had not implemented the usual warning systems to prevent the treatment within the recommended withdrawal period.  Mr Lor was fined the sum of $20,000 under Rule 50(5) for failing to adhere to the requirements of Trainers’ Handbook Regulation 69(h) in that he failed to take all proper precautions to ensure the recommended withdrawal period is applied to the administration of any medication containing a prohibited substance.

He said after the 700 Metres SEA SAPPHIRE was able to cross FUN N FUN TOGETHER to lead on the rail. Trainer P C Ng confirmed the instructions issued but stated such instructions were not binding and that the option was available to race outside the lead if SEA SAPPHIRE was unable to lead.  After considering his explanations, the Stewards advised K Teetan that he had made an error of judgement in the early stages by continuing to ride his mount forward to cross FUN N FUN TOGETHER, particularly when the early and middle stages of the event were run inside of standard time.

He added with the middle stages of the event being run outside of standard time, THUNDER BLINK did not travel well and for this reason he elected to allow his mount to follow SUNLIGHT POWER into the event from the 800 Metres.

He further stated that when placed under pressure in the Home Straight THUNDER BLINK, which was having its only third race start in Hong Kong, lay out and did  not respond to his riding which he attributed to the horse’s inexperience.  Trainer K H Ting confirmed the instructions were to endeavour to hold a more forward position and stated that with THUNDER BLINK stepping up to Class 3 grade today, its inexperience resulted in it not being able to race in a competitive manner.

2024-07-10,J304,HK_2023_J304,NEBRASKAN,2,"The Stewards opened an inquiry into Z Purton’s riding of NEBRASKAN with particular emphasis placed on the vigour he applied on the horse in the Home Straight.  Evidence was taken from Jockey Purton and Trainer J Size.  Z Purton explained that his instructions were to ride his mount in a forward position and after riding NEBRASKAN along in the early stages, NEBRASKAN shifted ground in the Back Straight and making the turn after the 600 Metres lay out which required him to have to apply pressure to his right rein to correct his mount.  He said on entering the Home Straight NEBRASKAN continued to shift ground which impacted upon his ability to apply full vigour to the horse in the Home Straight.  He added that after making contact with PRINCE OF PORTY passing the 175 Metres and with LEAN MASTER near the 150 Metres, he was then concerned that NEBRASKAN would continue to shift ground and for this reason he did not apply full vigour to NEBRASKAN between the 150 Metres and the 50 Metres.  He further stated that when he was satisfied that NEBRASKAN was properly balanced, he was able to ride NEBRASKAN out to the finish over the final 50 Metres.  Mr Size confirmed the instructions were to hold a forward position.  After considering the evidence, the inquiry was adjourned to a date and time to be fixed.  A veterinary inspection immediately following the race did not show any significant findings. <14/7/2024 Adjourned Injury – 10 July 2024 Happy Valley Racemeeting – Race 7 (818)> The Stewards today resumed their inquiry which was adjourned on 10 July 2024 in relation to Z Purton’s handling of NEBRASKAN in this event.  Further evidence today was taken from Jockey Purton and Mr J Size, trainer of NEBRASKAN.  Evidence today was also taken from Mr T Lam, part-owner of NEBRASKAN.  The Stewards also considered a detailed report from the Racing Integrity and Betting Analysis Department of the Club which reported that NEBRASKAN was well supported with its odds contracting from 9.8 to 7.85 just prior to the commencement of the event and there was no irregular market moves identified in any other betting platform.  On this basis the Stewards were satisfied that there was no integrity concern in relation to the running of this event.  Having considered further explanation provided by Jockey Purton today, the Stewards were satisfied:",4,7
