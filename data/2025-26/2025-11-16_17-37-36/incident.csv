2025-10-15,J253,HK_2023_J253,THE PERFECT MATCH,2,"Bumped shortly after the start.  The Stewards considered a protest/objection lodged by C L Chau, rider of THE PERFECT MATCH, 3rd placegetter, against THUNDER PRINCE (H Bowman) being declared 2nd placegetter alleging interference near the 200 Metres.  After considering the evidence the Stewards found that after being held up for clear running behind KING GLORIOSO approaching the 200 Metres THUNDER PRINCE then shifted out and made contact with THE PERFECT MATCH, resulting in that horse being taken out slightly.  As the Stewards could not be comfortably satisfied that had that incident not occurred, THE PERFECT MATCH would have finished in advance of THUNDER PRINCE, the protest/objection was overruled and weighed-in was declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.  At a subsequent inquiry H Bowman was advised in similar circumstances he should exercise more care.  In assessing the incident the Stewards took into consideration that Jockey Bowman advised that he had anticipated KING GLORIOSO to continue to shift in which would have presented him with clear running.  When questioned regarding his riding between the 300 Metres and the 200 Metres and as to whether there was an opportunity to ride his mount with more vigour C L Chau stated that he was asked to obtain a position where comfortable but did not place his mount under pressure too soon as THE PERFECT MATCH was found to have bled previously.  He said with these instructions in mind, after entering the Home Straight, whilst encouraging his horse to improve, he did not ride it with full vigour having regard to his instructions and also the fact that THE PERFECT MATCH lay in during that section of the race.  He added that when he reached the 200 Metres he then applied full vigour to his mount and THE PERFECT MATCH finished the race off well following contact with THUNDER PRINCE.  Trainer C S Shum confirmed the instructions and the reasons as to why such instructions were issued and expressed satisfaction with Jockey Chau’s riding.  Having considered the evidence the Stewards found the tactics adopted by Jockey Chau were reasonable in the circumstances.  After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on THE PERFECT MATCH at the request of Trainer C S Shum.  The Veterinary Surgeon said this examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse’s trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, THE PERFECT MATCH will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.",3,4

When questioned regarding his riding in the early stages M F Poon stated that the instructions were to take up an on-pace position behind the leaders.  He said in the early stages he was unable to cross runners to his inside which resulted in VOYAGE BUBBLE being caught in a three wide position.  He stated that as a result he then elected to ride his mount forward with a view to crossing HAPPY TOGETHER and at the same time requiring MY WISH to have to be ridden forward to cross and race outside the lead.  He said after being crowded by MY WISH leaving the 900 Metres he was then obliged to race in a position three wide and without cover thereafter.  Trainer P F Yiu confirmed the instructions were to hold an on-pace position whilst acknowledging it may have been difficult for the horse to obtain cover with a number of light weight runners drawn to its inside.  After considering his explanation the Stewards advised Jockey Poon that he had made an error of judgement in the early stages by continuing forward to make too much use of his mount to cross runners to his inside, particularly with his mount racing first up and carrying top weight of 135 lbs.

Subsequently the Stewards considered a protest/objection lodged by Jockey Z Purton and Trainer P C Ng alleging interference against EVER LUCK after the 550 Metres.  After considering all the evidence it was established that EVER LUCK ran out abruptly near the 550 Metres despite the efforts of its rider J Orman to prevent the horse from shifting ground.  In this incident GEORGIAN SIGMA was badly hampered when taken wider.  After considering the incident, the manner in which both horses finished the race off and the margin of 1 ¾ lengths between the two horses at the end of the race, the Stewards overruled the protest/objection when they could not be comfortably satisfied that had the interference not have occurred that GEORGIAN SIGMA would have finished in advance of EVER LUCK.  Accordingly, weighed-in was declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.

2025-11-09,H334,HK_2022_H334,BEAUTY CRESCENT,12,When questioned regarding his riding Y L Chung explained that his instructions were to lead the event but if the pace was too fast he was given the option to obtain a position with cover behind the lead.  He said in the early stages he rode his mount along to attempt to lead the race and when positioned slightly behind DROMBEG BANNER in the early stages he continued to encourage his mount forward to hold the lead.  He said after improving into the lead to the inside of DROMBEG BANNER near the 1100 Metres BEAUTY CRESCENT then commenced to race keenly when DROMBEG BANNER was positioned to his outside.  He added that this resulted in the pace of the event during the early and middle stages of the race being run inside of standard time.  After considering his explanation the Stewards advised Jockey Chung that he had made an error of judgement in the early stages by continuing to endeavour to maintain the lead when the pace of the event was being run inside of standard time and in the circumstances he should have allowed DROMBEG BANNER to cross his mount and take advantage of the option to obtain a position with cover behind that runner.,4,10

When questioned H Doyle stated that her instructions were to endeavour to lead the race and find the rail as DROMBEG BANNER performs best in this position.  She said after commencing well and riding her mount along, when positioned to the outside and in advance of BEAUTY CRESCENT, she continued to ride her mount forward with a view to crossing BEAUTY CRESCENT in compliance with her instructions.  She said when BEAUTY CRESCENT maintained the position to her inside and she was not clear to cross that runner she then near the 1000 Metres restrained her mount to take a position to the outside of BEAUTY CRESCENT.  She added as a result of the tactics she adopted in the early stages the race was run inside of standard time through that section of the race.  When questioned regarding her riding from the 450 Metres and if there was an opportunity to ride her mount more patiently, given the fast early pace, Jockey Doyle stated that making the turn DROMBEG BANNER did not travel well and for this reason near the 450 Metres she commenced to ride her mount along to make up ground on BEAUTY CRESCENT and after initially responding to her riding the horse’s run ended near the 100 Metres.  After considering her explanation, whilst the Stewards found the tactics she adopted in the early stages were reasonable, she was advised that in the circumstances she made an error of judgement from the 450 Metres by placing her mount under pressure too soon, particularly having regard to the early and middle stages of the event being run inside of standard time.  Trainer P C Ng confirmed the instructions issued.",6,10
