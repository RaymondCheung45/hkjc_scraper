After considering all the evidence, the Stewards found that the incident occurred due to minor shifts from both horses and therefore no action was taken.  When questioned, Z Purton stated that after commencing awkwardly his mount then raced in restricted room shortly after the start between PARTERRE and BABY CRYSTAL.  He said when both runners then shifted ground approaching the 900 Metres, he was obliged to check his mount and as a result KA YING VICTORY got its head up and lost ground.  He added that this resulted in KA YING VICTORY settling further back in the field than anticipated.  He further stated that he elected then to follow BABY CRYSTAL in the race as he felt this would provide his mount with the best opportunity to improve into the event.  He said when BABY CRYSTAL did not quicken from the 500 Metres KA YING VICTORY became badly held up for clear running behind that runner at which point he was anticipating CARROLL STREET, which appeared to be under pressure, to give ground.  He added that when CARROLL STREET maintained its position to the inside of BABY CRYSTAL, his mount continued to be held up for clear running until near the 100 Metres where he was able to commence riding his mount along.

Mr Mo expressed satisfaction with the manner in which Jockey Teetan had ridden the horse on the Home Turn.

H Bowman stated that due to the pattern of racing during the meeting, he felt it was advantageous to endeavour to get his horse to the outside, particularly as NOBLE PURSUIT races best when in this position.  He said for this reason he elected to shift out to follow SUNSTRIDER after the 1500 Metres as he felt such manoeuvre would allow SUNSTRIDER to shift to the rail and provide NOBLE PURSUIT with a trailing position behind DILBAGH.  He said when SUNSTRIDER remained racing one-off, SIMPLE HEDGE was able to improve to that runner’s inside and as a result NOBLE PURSUIT settled further back in the field than what he had anticipated.  He added along the Back Straight whilst the opportunity was available to shift in and follow SIMPLE HEDGE, he elected to shift out to attempt to position his mount to the outside but was prevented from doing so when SPEED DRAGON held its position to his outside.  He said as a result near the 550 Metres he was forced to go back to the inside to start a forward move and follow SIMPLE HEDGE.  H Bowman reinforced his views that NOBLE PURSUIT was disadvantaged by racing to the inside and also was not assisted by the track pattern on the night as it was forced to make a run on the inside.",4,9

Evidence was taken from Trainer D J Whyte, H Bentley, rider of CHEVAL VALIANT, and Apprentice P N Wong, rider of FAST RESPONDER.  Jockey Bentley stated that his instructions were to hold the lead and to carry his whip in his right hand as CHEVAL VALIANT has a tendency to lay in in its races.  He stated that when he first asked CHEVAL VALIANT to improve from the 600 Metres it commenced to lay in and for this reason approaching the 450 Metres he took his hand from his left rein to regather his mount and attempt to straighten it.  He said at the same time he shifted his weight in the saddle towards the outside to further prevent CHEVAL VALIANT from shifting in.  When questioned regarding his left arm extending out and away from CHEVAL VALIANT, Jockey Bentley stated that it was a common trait in his riding that his left arm would extend away from his horse when performing similar actions.  Apprentice Wong confirmed that she was given no instruction in relation to the positioning of CHEVAL VALIANT, however, she was aware that having previously ridden the horse before that CHEVAL VALIANT does have a tendency to lay in in its races and potentially a run may become available on the stand rail.  After considering all the evidence, the Stewards were satisfied that CHEVAL VALIANT had shifted in due to its own racing manners and that Jockey Bentley had endeavoured to prevent his mount from shifting in but was unable to do so which resulted in FAST RESPONDER obtaining a clear run to its outside.",4,9

He said from the 600 Metres his intention was to improve to the outside of COSMO NAVIGATOR to follow PRIME MORTAR with the view to shifting to PRIME MORTAR’S outside in the Home Straight, to ensure his mount was given clear and uninterrupted running.  He said as he commenced to shift out from the 500 Metres PRIME MORTAR which had raced very wide and without cover commenced to give ground which resulted in SKY JEWELLERY then being positioned to the inside of PRIME MORTAR making the Home turn and unable to shift to that runner’s outside.  Jockey Bowman added that on straightening he then attempted to obtain clear running between GOOD PROSPECT and GREAT SPIRIT, however, when GOOD PROSPECT shifted out he was then obliged to shift to that runner’s inside where he was able to commence to ride his mount along.  He said after the 250 Metres SKY JEWELLERY then became badly held up behind TAIHANG SCENERY and as a result did not obtain clear running until after the 100 Metres where it ran home strongly.  When questioned if there was an opportunity to shift out near the 500 Metres to follow PRIME MORTAR before that runner commenced to give ground, Jockey Bowman stated that having regard to his mount being inexperienced and carrying top weight of 135 lbs, he was reluctant to do so.  Trainer J Size confirmed the instructions issued.  After considering his explanation, the Stewards advised Jockey Bowman that, in their opinion, leaving the 500 Metres he would have been advantaged by immediately shifting to the outside of COSMO NAVIGATOR to follow PRIME MORTAR which would have prevented SKY JEWELLERY from improving to the inside of PRIME MORTAR and providing clear running in the Home Straight.

He said as he was positioned slightly in advance of MEGA BONUS he elected to allow SUPER CHARIZZARD to continue forward to cross that runner as he felt it would be a disadvantage to remain racing slightly in advance of MEGA BONUS.  He said after crossing MEGA BONUS he then encouraged his mount to improve from that point and after initially responding gave ground in the Home  Straight.  After considering his explanation, Jockey Ferraris was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, his best option would have been to remain racing to the outside of MEGA BONUS and secondly that once he allowed SUPER CHARIZZARD to stride forward of that runner, he should have provided his mount with the opportunity to travel comfortably at that stage rather than continuing to urge his mount forward.

He said the decision not to do so was also influenced by the fact that HELENE FEELING was up in weight tonight carrying 133 lbs and he felt the most important factor when riding the horse was to ensure that it travelled comfortably and was able to build momentum into the race.

When questioned regarding his riding rounding the turn and in the early part of the Home Straight and as to whether there was an opportunity to improve to the outside of WINNING HEART, H Bentley stated that given the hard run that his mount had sustained in the early stages, he was reluctant to improve around runners on the Home Turn and for this reason he remained racing behind WINNING HEART.  He added when WINNING HEART shifted out approaching the Home Straight he then attempted to obtain clear running to the inside of WINNING HEART and to the outside of ISLAND GOLDEN.

He added that in the Home Straight he initially improved to the inside of THE GOLDEN SCENERY with a view to then improving to the inside of WOODFIRE BRO which had shifted out slightly entering the Home Straight.  He said when WOODFIRE BRO shifted back in WINNING DRAGON was briefly held up before being shifted to the outside of WOODFIRE BRO approaching the 350 Metres.  He further stated that approaching the 250 Metres the intention was to improve between C P BRAVE and HELENE FEELING but when those two runners shifted ground slightly he was obliged to continue to shift to the outside of HELENE FEELING where he secured clear running after the 150 Metres and his mount found the line well.  Trainer A S Cruz confirmed the instructions issued and stated that with WINNING DRAGON dropping back in distance to 1600 Metres he did not believe the horse would have sufficient pace to hold a more favourable position from its awkward barrier.  He added that he was satisfied with the tactics adopted by Jockey Avdulla in endeavouring to improve along the inside as, in his opinion, the racing pattern of today had favoured runners being ridden in this manner.

An inquiry into the matter was adjourned to a date to be fixed to allow Trainer W K Mo to attend who was not currently present in Hong Kong.  Before being allowed to race again, LEGENDARY IMPACT will be subjected to an official veterinary examination. <9/4/2025 Adjourned Inquiry – 6 April 2025 Sha Tin Racemeeting – Race 6 (567)> The Stewards today conducted an inquiry into the withdrawal of LEGENDARY IMPACT from the said race. Evidence was taken from Trainer W K Mo, Assistant Trainer K H Lam, Work Riders S L Lee and C K Sze, and Dr B S Forbes, Head of Veterinary Regulation, Welfare and Biosecurity Policy. After considering all the evidence, the Stewards established that despite having systems in place to prevent the administration of treatment on raceday, subsequent to LEGENDARY IMPACT working on the morning of 6 April 2025, it was inadvertently treated with Swede Clay, a topical treatment which does not contain any prohibited substances and is the usual treatment for the horse post track work. The Stewards were satisfied that the treatment was an oversight and not intentional conduct. Mr Mo pleaded guilty to a charge under Rule 155(29) for causing the application of the raceday treatment in that he did not have proper processes in place to prevent such treatment occurring. Mr Mo was fined the sum of $20,000. A report will be made to the Stables Management in relation to the conduct of the above staff members.",WX,6

2025-04-06,K150,HK_2024_K150,AUTUMN VIBES,5,"When questioned, Z Purton stated that his mount jumped awkwardly and as a result lost ground and settled at the tail of the field.  He said in the early stages AUTUMN VIBES raced keenly and was steadied away from SHAMUS STORM near the 1000 Metres.  When questioned regarding his riding in the Home Straight, Z Purton stated that after improving to the inside of SHAMUS STORM on entering the Home Straight he commenced to place his mount under pressure, however, when VIEW ALL THINGS commenced to give ground quickly he became held up behind that runner between the 350 Metres and the 250 Metres.  He added after improving to the outside of VIEW ALL THINGS, he was then placed close to the heels of SHAMUS STORM for some distance thereafter.  When questioned regarding his vigour from near the 200 Metres, Z Purton stated that, in his opinion, AUTUMN VIBES was under pressure and laying in and for this reason he did not fully test his mount through this section of the race as he was of the opinion the horse was not responding to his efforts.  Trainer J Richards stated that if AUTUMN VIBES commenced well the option was to take up a more forward position but accepted that on jumping AUTUMN VIBES commenced awkwardly and settled back.  He added whilst acknowledging AUTUMN VIBES had been held up in the early part of the Home Straight he felt there was an opportunity for Jockey Purton to place more pressure on his mount from near the 200 Metres.  After considering his explanation the Stewards advised Jockey Purton that, in their opinion, he should have ridden his mount with more vigour after the 200 Metres to fully demonstrate that the horse was unable to respond further to his riding and in such circumstances to ride his mounts in such a manner to leave no room for query.  A veterinary inspection immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of AUTUMN VIBES was considered disappointing as compared to its previous race starts.  Before being allowed to race again, AUTUMN VIBES will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.",12,8

When questioned regarding his riding in the Home Straight H Bowman stated that LOVEISINTHEAIR, which was having its third race start, did not appreciate racing amongst horses and as a result he was reluctant to force his mount to improve between NORTHERN FIRE BALL and SPICY SPANGLE.  He said when he observed NORTHERN FIRE BALL to shift out away from the rail near the 200 Metres he then considered allowing his mount to improve to the inside of NORTHERN FIRE BALL as it was already shifting in towards the running rail.  He said when NORTHERN FIRE BALL did not leave sufficient room for LOVEISINTHEAIR to improve to its inside he was obliged to stop riding with the whip and direct LOVEISINTHEAIR to the outside of NORTHERN FIRE BALL approaching the 50 Metres to ensure his mount obtained clear running to the finish.

He said in the early stages he rode his mount along to comply with his instructions where he obtained a position outside the leader KINGLY DEMEANOR.  He said near the 1200 Metres he then urged his mount forward to cross KINGLY DEMEANOR which resulted in GALLANT EPOCH commencing to race keenly.  He added when positioned in advance of KINGLY DEMEANOR near the 1100 Metres he encouraged his mount forward to cross that runner but GALLANT EPOCH did not show sufficient pace to do so and as a result he was obliged to make further use of his mount entering the Back Straight where he eventually was able to cross KINGLY DEMEANOR near the 800 Metres.  Trainer K W Lui confirmed the instructions issued and stated that GALLANT EPOCH may have been disadvantaged by having its first race start at Happy Valley.  After considering the sectional times of the event which showed the early stages of the race being run well inside of standard time, L Hewitson was advised by the Stewards that he had made an error of judgement in the early stages by continuing to endeavour to go forward to cross KINGLY DEMEANOR.

He said in the early stages when positioned to the outside of MULTIDARLING he was obliged to settle slightly further back to avoid covering additional ground.  He added making the Home Turn HO HO STAR commenced to travel reasonably well and after entering the Home Straight he was reluctant to place his mount under full pressure as he wanted to give HO HO STAR the opportunity to work into the race.  He said approaching the 300 Metres after shifting to the inside of COMMANDING MISSILE he then placed his mount under full pressure where it finished the race off reasonably well.  When questioned if there was an opportunity to ride his mount with more vigour between the 400 Metres and the 300 Metres M Chadwick stated that he felt HO HO STAR was travelling well at this point and had he commenced to ride it along too soon it would not have finished the race off as well as it did.  Trainer C H Yip confirmed the instructions issued and advised that in the circumstances there was the opportunity to ride HO HO STAR with more vigour than Jockey Chadwick did in the early part of the Home Straight.

He added when GLORY ELITE maintained its position to his outside near the 900 Metres and as its rider Z Purton showed intent on crossing LADY’S CHOICE he then elected near the 900 Metres to allow GLORY ELITE to cross LADY’S CHOICE as he was of the opinion the pace of the event was too fast.  He said after obtaining a trailing position behind GLORY ELITE, LADY’S CHOICE travelled only fairly and for this reason near the 500 Metres he elected to shift LADY’S CHOICE to the outside of GLORY ELITE to encourage it to maintain its position and to commence to improve into the event.  He said after entering the Home Straight he held his mount together for a short distance before commencing to ride it out to the finish of the event and LADY’S CHOICE continued to respond to his riding to the line.

He said after riding his mount along in the early stages he continued to urge GLORY ELITE forward to cross LADY’S CHOICE.  He said when K Teetan, the rider of LADY’S CHOICE, maintained his position in the lead, he was obliged to make further use of his mount to cross that runner to comply with his instructions.

After considering his explanation and taking into account the racing history of GLORY ELITE which confirmed that the horse had won its three races from leading and Jockey Purton was riding to the instructions issued, the Stewards found the tactics adopted by Jockey Purton were in all the circumstances reasonable.

He said near the 1100 Metres when there was no opportunity to obtain cover he continued forward on MISTER DAPPER and as a result was obliged to make further use of his mount making the first turn to cross BEAUTY LIVE to avoid racing wide.  When questioned if there was an opportunity to remain racing to the outside of HE WAS ME rather than continuing forward of that runner, B Avdulla stated that as he was advised by Trainer D Eustace that MISTER DAPPER is one-paced, when HE WAS ME appeared to be under pressure he allowed MISTER DAPPER to continue to go forward and cross that runner to obtain a position on the rail so as to avoid holding his mount’s momentum.  He added after crossing to the rail he continued to ride MISTER DAPPER along from the 500 Metres in order to encourage the horse to finish the race off strongly.  Trainer Eustace confirmed the instructions issued and advised that having regard to the early stages of the event being run inside of standard time he felt that there was a brief opportunity for Jockey Avdulla to ride his mount with more patience from the 600 Metres.

He said as a result E UNIVERSE was obliged to race wide and without cover for the majority of the event before giving ground in the Home Straight.  Trainer C Fownes confirmed the instructions but had hoped that E UNIVERSE would be able to lead the event and agreed that the horse was disadvantaged by being obliged to race wide and without cover for the majority of the event.  After considering Apprentice Wong’s explanation and taking into account the times of the event which identified the race was run outside of standard time in the early stages, he was advised, in the opinion of the Stewards, he would have been better suited by allowing E UNIVERSE to continue forward to cross INNO CENTURY to avoid covering additional ground.",14,5

When questioned regarding his riding Z Purton stated that he had anticipated holding a handy position.  He said after being checked at the start when crowded his mount settled further back in the field than intended.  He said with the early stages of the event being run outside of standard time he elected to commence a forward move from the 1200 Metres as ENSUED is a one-paced horse that requires momentum and he was confident with the horse’s ability to run out a strong 2400 Metres.  He added after improving to the outside of DUBAI HONOUR near the 1100 Metres that runner held its position to his inside and when ENSUED was unable to cross DUBAI HONOUR he was obliged to race wide and without cover thereafter.  When questioned if there was an opportunity to endeavour to obtain a position behind DUBAI HONOUR when unable to cross that runner Z Purton stated that as his mount requires momentum in its races he felt this was not in the best interests of the horse to ride it in this manner.

2025-07-09,K202,HK_2024_K202,FRIENDS OF SHAJING,4,"Bumped shortly after the start.  The Stewards opened an inquiry into Jockey C L Chau's riding of the horse and in particular the vigour he showed over the last 600 Metres of the event.  When questioned C L Chau stated that he was instructed to have the horse settle where comfortable and had anticipated taking up a midfield position.  He said making the turn after the 600 Metres his mount commenced to lay out and became awkward which he attributed to the horse having its first race start at Happy Valley.  He said as a result he was required to balance his mount through this section of the race which resulted in SIR CHARGE and THOUSAND SPIRIT improving past his mount.  He added that as he continued to make the bend after the 600 Metres it was necessary for him to balance the horse as it was still having difficulty making the turn and entering the Home Straight it took some time to fully balance up before he was able to fully ride his mount from near the 200 Metres.  He said over the final 200 Metres he continued to test the horse to the best of his ability in a hands and heels manner whereby his mount finished the race off strongly, particularly over the final 100 Metres.  Trainer C S Shum confirmed the instructions issued and stated that whilst the horse had numerous barrier trials leading into tonight’s race it had not barrier trialed at the Happy Valley circuit.  He said for this reason he had stressed to Jockey Chau to ensure that the horse was fully balanced before he applied full pressure to the horse in the Home Straight.  Mr Shum expressed satisfaction with the manner in which Jockey Chau rode FRIENDS OF SHAJING.  After considering the evidence the Stewards advised Jockey Chau that, in their opinion, he should have made a greater effort from the 600 Metres to hold his position to the inside of SIR CHARGE and in the Home Straight there was an opportunity for him to ride his mount with more vigour, particularly between the 200 Metres and the 100 Metres after the horse had become fully balanced.  Jockey Chau was advised that he would be expected in future to ensure he rides in a manner so as to leave no room for query.",4,6
